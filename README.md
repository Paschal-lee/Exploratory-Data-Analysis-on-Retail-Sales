# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

## Description:
In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is
to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can
help the retail business make informed decisions.

# Dataset Used:
- <a href="https://github.com/Paschal-lee/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Retail-Sales/blob/main/retail_sales_dataset.csv">Dataset</a>

## Key Concepts and Challenges:
Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.
Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA

# Insights Uncovered

## Sales Trends:
Monthly and quarterly trends reveal periods of high and low sales, which can guide promotional planning.
Yearly sales trends indicate overall growth or decline patterns.
Customer Demographics:

## Gender distribution can highlight the dominant demographic group.
Age distribution shows the primary age range of customers.
Product Categories:

The bar chart of sales per category helps identify the most and least popular product categories.
Customer Behavior:

The "Quantity Trends" and "Price per Unit Trends" charts show how purchasing habits and pricing influence sales.
